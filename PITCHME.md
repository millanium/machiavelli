## A bit of history

## Structure

Thread-Based Testing

Organized threads of activity
* Form of thread, thread is not necessarily a session
* Thread is a set of one or more activities intended to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

+++

## Test Facilities

* Power meter calibration method
* Backup test jig validation
* Create standard test images

+++

## Test Strategy

* Accuracy Testing
* Sampling strategy
* Preliminary-testing
* Log file analysis program
* Transaction Flow Testing
* Essential Performance Testing
* Safety Testing
* Compliance Testing

+++

## Test Management

* Change protocol definition
* Build protocol definition
* Test cycle protocol definition
* Bug reporting protocol definition
* Bug triage
* Fix verifications

## Test charters goal?

* Intake Session - Gather information you need from project stakeholders
* Survey Session - Learn the application, collection the information which help you to make a test approach
* Setup Session - Create a test infrastructure needed for testing the application
* Analysis Session - Get ideas for deep coverage, risk assessment, acceptance criteria
* Deep Coverage Session - Describe details of your tests
* Closure Session - Get ready to release

## How to end the session?

* Past - What happened?
* Results - What did you find?
* Obstacles - What issues prevented you testing?
* Outlook - What still needs to be done?
* Feelings - What do you feel about the testing?
