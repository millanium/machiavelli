## What is Exploratory testing?

"It is, of course, difficult to have the machine check how well the program matches the intent of the programmer without giving a great deal of information about that intent. If we had some simple way of presenting that kind of information to the machine for checking, we might just as well have the machine do the coding. Let us not forget that complex logical operations occur through a combination of simple instructions executed by the computer and not by the computer logically deducing or inferring what is desired.”
Jerry Weinberg

## A bit of history

Cem Kaner had coined a term—”exploratory testing”—to represent the opposite of scripted testing.

1996, first testing class called Exploratory Testing, James Bach
1999, 2000, Microsoft started with Session-Based Test Management

Exploratory testing is unscripted, unrehearsed testing. Its effectiveness depends on several intangibles: the skill of the tester, their intuition, their experience, and their ability to follow hunches.

Session-Based Testing
- structured exploratory testing
- testing in sessions called charters 45min

Charter is mission for the session, contract.

## How to organize Exploratory testing?

Thread-Based Testing

Organized threads of activity
Form of thread, thread is not necessarily a session
Thread is a set of one or more activities intended to solve a problem or achieve an objective.

* Create standard test images

+++

Test Strategy

* Accuracy Testing
* Sampling strategy
* Preliminary-testing
* Log file analysis program
* Transaction Flow Testing
* Essential Performance Testing
* Safety Testing
   - warnings and errors FRS review
   - tool for forcing errors
* Compliance Testing
* Test Protocol V1.0 doc.

## How to generate test charters?

What is the goal you want to achieve with the test session?

* Intake Session - Gather information you need from project stakeholders
* Survey Session - Learn the application, collection the information which help you to make a test approach
* Setup Session - Create a test infrastracture needed for testing the application
* Analysis Session - Get ideas for deep coverage, risk assesment, acceptance criteria
* Deep Coverage Session - Describe details of your tests
* Closure Session - Get ready to release

## How to end the session?

* Past - What happened?
* Results - What did you find?
* Obstacles - What issues prevented you testing?
* Outlook - What still needs to be done?
* Feelings - What do you feel about the testing?

## What tools to use?

* Session tester
* TestRail
* Evernote 
* Testnote.io
* Exploratory testing chrome extension
* Rapid Reporter
